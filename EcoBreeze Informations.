# EcoBreeze - Air Purification System

**EcoBreeze** is an innovative air purification device designed to filter polluted air and release purified air into the surroundings. 
This device is ideal for areas with high air pollution levels such as traffic zones, factories, and industrial areas.
It uses advanced sensors to detect air pollution and activates automatically when pollution levels exceed a threshold.
The system operates on solar energy, making it cost-effective and environmentally friendly.

## Features
- **Air Quality Detection**: Uses sensors to measure the pollution level in the air.
- **Automatic Activation**: The device starts automatically when pollution levels are high.
- **LED Indicators**: Displays the air quality status using color-coded LEDs:
  - **Red**: High pollution
  - **Yellow**: Medium pollution
  - **Green**: Purified air
- **Display Panel**: Shows real-time air quality levels on a screen.
- **Solar Powered**: The device runs on solar energy, making it energy-efficient and low-cost.
- **Compact Design**: Can be made into a compact version for home use, as well as a larger version for industrial areas.

## Installation

To get started with the **EcoBreeze** project:

1. **Device Setup**: 
   - Place the EcoBreeze device in an area with high pollution, such as near busy roads or factories.
   - Ensure the solar panel is positioned to receive maximum sunlight.

2. **Sensor Calibration**: 
   - Calibrate the sensors to measure the air quality based on local pollution levels.
   - Adjust the threshold levels for pollution detection (e.g., red, yellow, green).

3. **Powering Up**: 
   - Connect the device to a power source or let it charge via the solar panel.
   - The device should automatically power on and begin monitoring the air quality.

## How It Works
1. **Pollution Detection**: The sensors continuously monitor the air quality in real-time.
When pollution levels exceed a certain threshold, the system activates.
2. **Activation**: The device starts filtering polluted air, drawing in harmful particles from the surrounding area.
3. **LED Status**: The air quality status is displayed through the LED lights:
   - **Red LED** indicates high pollution levels, and the system begins filtering polluted air.
   - **Yellow LED** indicates medium pollution levels.
   - **Green LED** indicates that the air has been purified.
4. **Display**: The device shows detailed pollution data on a screen, providing users with real-time information about air quality.
5. **Solar Power**: The device runs on solar power, making it both cost-effective and eco-friendly.
